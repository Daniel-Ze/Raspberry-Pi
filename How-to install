Raspberry Pi configuration:
  sudo raspi-config
    ->1 Expand Filesystem
    ->6 Enable Camera
  sudo reboot

Keeping RaspianOS up-to-date:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo reboot

Install dependencies for the raspberry pi camera:
  sudo apt-get install python-dev
  sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
  sudo apt-get install python-picamera

Copying camera-timelapse.py in your home directory and make time-lapse storage directory:
Copy the python-script 'camera-timelapse.py' from your USB-flashdrive to /home/pi

Open the terminal and make the time-lapse directory in your home-folder:
  cd /home/pi
  mkdir time-lapse

Make the file 'time-lapse-launcher.sh' executable:
  chmod 755 time-laps-launcher.sh

Edit the rc.local file to execute the 'time-lapse-launcher.sh' to start
'camera-timelapse.py' on boot-up:
  sudo nano /etc/rc.local
  Add the following line to the end before 'exit 0':
    /home/pi/time-lapse-launcher.sh &

ctrl+x  #Exit nano
y #(yes) confirm saving the file

Reboot and check if the script is running:
  sudo reboot

  pgrep -af python
Something like this '14795 python camera-timelapse.py' should show up in the terminal

Also check /home/pi/time-lapse/ for the first picture.

Congrats! You have a running time-lapse raspberry pi with infrared for night-vision
which takes a picture every 25 seconds (to change this you have to adjust the last
argument in camera-timelapse.py -> time.sleep(20))!
